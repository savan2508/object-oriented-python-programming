Object-Oriented Python Programming
This repository contains examples of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. The code examples cover various OOP concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Additional content will be added regularly.

Contents
The repository is organized into different directories, each covering a specific OOP concept. The directories and their contents are as follows:

inheritance: Examples of inheritance in Python, including single and multiple inheritance, and method overriding.
polymorphism: Examples of polymorphism in Python, including function overloading, operator overloading, and abstract classes.
encapsulation: Examples of encapsulation in Python, including private and protected members, and getters and setters.
abstraction: Examples of abstraction in Python, including abstract classes and interfaces.
Usage
To use this code, simply clone or download the repository and navigate to the directory that contains the OOP concept you're interested in. Each directory contains one or more Python files that demonstrate the concept in action.
