Title: Flatmates bill
Description: An app that gets input the amount of a bill for a particular period
and days that each of the flatmates stayed in the house for that period and return
how much each flatmate has to pay. It also generates a PDF report stating the names
of the flatmates, and how much each of them had to pay.

Objects:
    Bill: amount, period
    Flatmate: days_in_house, name, pays(),
    PdfReport:filename,save(),generate()

The objective is changed after the starting script. Instead of the creating class and
methods, it is easier to create a functions that can perform the task much more easily.
The original objective was to assume only two roommates, but now it can take any amount
of roommates and it can divide the rent as per their days stay at the house.
